🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Model

This project tackles the classic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster challenge hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, gender, class, and more.

🧰 Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn,matplotlib,xgboost
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📁 Project Structure
- `train.csv`: Training dataset used to build and validate the model.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset used for generating predictions.
- `submission.csv`: Final output file formatted for Kaggle submission.
- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

🧠 Model Overview
- Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression, Random forest and XGBoost
- Why: Chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness on binary classification tasks
The notebook walks through:
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Generating predictions for the test set
- Preparing a submission file for Kaggle

📌 Dataset Source
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle under the [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).


📊 Results
- Kaggle Score: 0.76555 on public leaderboard
- my score : 0.821229
- Performance: Solid baseline accuracy with potential for improvement via ensemble methods or hyperparameter tuning
